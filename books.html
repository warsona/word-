    WONDERFUL CREATURES 
    
    Women are outstanding creatures the world has seen. They are made from the rib of men, according to the Bible, and rely on each other. 
    Women have played and still pay a key role in the progression of mankind. They are very essential and therefore should be pampered. Bart Jackson said, “Behind every great man there's a great woman". This statement is undoubtedly true, because women are very loving and caring.
      They are the backbone of our world. It is the era to acknowledge their compassion and sacrifices for mankind. Women deserve more than what they are being offered. They should be offered with a mighty and quality crown of acknowledgement. We should avoid pounding on their errors and genuinely acknowledge them. Those who will stand with me to hail the sacrifices of women are worthy of been called wise. 
    They nurse, take care of us, and do things that no other creature of God can do. Hail to all women out there! They truly deserve more.
       Have you ever sat down to view the abilities of women? They carried you and me in their womb for nine months, enduring both physical and emotional challenges. There is an Akan proverb which states that, “Only  the hen knows what its chicks will consume". Women are real heroes and worth our appreciations celebration. They should be celebrated twice or more a year. The root of our existence deserves more attention than what they are been offered. 
    Women were supposed to be men's helper, but most women are the bread winners of their family due to their excess love for mankind. 
    Unlike those days, many women have refused to sit home and wait for the man to provide. They strive to go to school to upgrade themselves or learn a trade, which enables them compete with their counterpart in providing and taking care of the home.
    The true nature of women cannot and will not be fully discovered. This is because the more you discover some things about women, the more you will discover that what was previously discovered is nothing compared to what has been discovered. They are a mystery.
      Women are truly wonderful creatures. They have no match. The saying, "What a man can do a woman can do better,” is certainly true and the prove is right before us. We see their sacrifices each day. I will say,  even  the worst woman does not deserve to be called a beast or devil. Women are real angels in human form.  
    Everything God made was good, but I personally believe that women are special. I also personally believe that everything God made was very good when the woman was brought forth from rib of man.
    I offer my gratitude to and salute all women. Women are the best companions the world has ever seen. I will score the wonderful love of women to be hundred, because they are actually goddesses in disguise. Women are truly wonderful.
